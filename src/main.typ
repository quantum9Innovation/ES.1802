*Manifolds are (very special) sets (of points)*

#pause

- Manifolds are just a continuous set of points

#pause

- Moreover, at any given point, they look like a *Euclidean space*

- You know them as $RR^n$ i.e. *vector spaces* (roughly speaking)

#pause

- Euclidean space is the space we inhabit (not the full story; more on this later)

*What actually is a manifold then?*

- When we say that a manifold "looks like" a Euclidean space, we're actually talking about *homeomorphism*

  Two topological objects $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic to each other iff there exists a *homeomorphism* between them.

Determinants tell you how much the area of a unit square scales under some linear transformation $T$ (*bivectors* generalize this to any coordinate system).

        })
      })
    })
  )
)

== Bivectors

- Bivectors are formed using a very scary operator called the *wedge product*.

#pause

- Wedge products between any two vectors $vec(a)$ and $vec(b)$ exist in a vector space (we are free to define the basis vectors, but they look like some wedge product, e.g. $vec(e_1) and vec(e_2)$

== Multivolumes

- Because the multivolume of a parallelotope (as a function of its side vectors) is multilinear\*, we can (mathematicians would say _trivially_ even though this is very quixotic) derive the following algebraic properties:

#pause

#text(size: 12pt)[Not technically true, as we'll see later--we're actually dealing with signed multivolumes]

#pause

$c (vec(a) and vec(b)) = c vec(a) and vec(b) = vec(a) and c vec(b)$

#pause

$vec(a) and (vec(b) + vec(c)) = vec(a) and vec(b) + vec(a) and vec(c)$

#pause

*Multilinearity!*

== Properties of the Wedge Product

There are some others, too:

#pause

$vec(a) and vec(a) = 0$

_Parallelogram where opposite sides are the same is degenerate; area is zero_

#pause

$vec(a) and vec(b) = -vec(b) and vec(a)$

_This follows from the previous properties; this is why the determinant is *antisymmetric*!_

== Interesting Derivation of Antisymmetry Property

By the fact that $vec(u) and vec(u) = 0$, we have:

$(vec(a) + vec(b)) and (vec(a) + vec(b)) = 0$ #h(10pt) ($vec(u) = vec(a) + vec(b)$)

Distribute!

$vec(a) and vec(a) + vec(a) and vec(b) + vec(b) and vec(a) + vec(b) and vec(b) = 0$

Use $vec(u) and vec(u) = 0$ again! (but for different $vec(u)$)

$vec(a) and vec(b) + vec(b) and vec(a) = 0$\
$vec(a) and vec(b) = -vec(b) and vec(a)$

Only the *signed multivolume* of a parallelotope as a function of its side vectors is multilinear.

== Integration over 1 Manifolds

For a 1 manifold, we integrate over a 1-form that looks like $d x$.\

#pause

- In 1 dimension, this is a standard integral $integral f(x) space d x$

#pause

- In $n$ dimensions (where $n > 1$), you learned about this as a *line integral*:\ $integral_C space vec(f)(t) dot (d vec(r)(t))/(d t) space d t$

#pause

#v(12pt)

Notice the dimension of $f$ changes with $n$--there are $n$ differentials in $n$ dimensions, and we can integrate only over 1 manifolds using a 1 form.

#pause

#v(12pt)

Line integrals are really just:

$integral space (f_1(t) space d vec(e_1) + f_2(t) space d vec(e_2) + dots.h.c + f_n space d vec(e_n)) $

== Integration over 2 Manifolds

For a 2 manifold, we integrate over a 2-form that looks like $d x space d y$ ($d x and d y$ in disguise).\

#pause

- In 2 dimensions, an example is a surface integral (for calculating flux) $integral.double vec(f)(x, y) dot vec(n) space d S$

#pause

- A general integral over a 2 manifold in 2 dimensions looks like:\ $integral vec(f)(u, v) space d u and d v$

#pause

#v(12pt)

We can integrate over any surface of an $n$ dimensional space, where our differential is a *bivector* formed by two of $d vec(e_1)$, ..., $d vec(e_n)$.
There are therefore $mat(n; 2)$ differentials that make up the 2-form in $n$ space, and the function $vec(f)$ we integrate over must have this dimension.

#pause

#v(12pt)

$integral space (f_1(u, v) space d vec(e_1) and vec(e_2) + dots.h.c + f_2(u, v) space d vec(e_1) and vec(e_n) + dots.h.c + f_(n)(u, v) space d vec(e_(n-1)) and vec(e_n)) $

== Flux

What are we _actually_ doing when we calculate *flux*?

#pause

- Note that we always calculate the flux of a vector field $vec(F)$ (dim 3) over a surface (dim 2) embedded in $x y z$ space (dim 3).

- Note also that $mat(3; 2) = 3$, the dimension of $vec(F)$, as we would expect.

#pause

There are three differentials that make up the 2-form in $x y z$ space: $d x and d y$, $d x and d z$, and $d y and d z$.

#pause

Let $vec(F) = angle.l A(x,y,z), B(x,y,z), C(x,y,z) angle.r$. We will calculate the flux outward through each surface in the 2-form.
We will talk more about orientation later, but for the purpose of flux, we define the normal vector as being the cross product of two surface vectors (with right hand rule).

  ])
)

== Mathematical Maneuvering

#v(18pt)

- Remember that a manifold is *homeomorphic* to a Euclidean space (in this case, $RR^2$). This means there exists a mapping\* $x,y,z arrow.r u,v$, so we can write $u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z)$.

#text(size: 14pt)[\*where $x,y,z$ are in some subset of $RR^3$ (occupied by the manifold)]

- This mapping is called a "*chart*," which is part of an "*atlas*" for the manifold
  - Mathematicians take this map analogy very seriously because they cannot distinguish between homeomorphic objects in real life

#quote(attribution: "RenÃ© Thom (itinerant theoretician)")[
  Topology is precisely the mathematical discipline that allows the passage from local to globalâ¦
]

Don't let your mind be warped by these abstractions!

=== Computation

- Given $u(x,y,z),v(x,y,z)$ and $bold(F)(u,v)$, consider the inverse map $u,v arrow.r x,y,z$ that must also exist by the conditions of *homeomorphism* to find $x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)$.

- Now, take differentials using the chain rule:

$d x = (partial x)/(partial u) space d u + (partial x)/(partial v) space d v$,
$d y = (partial y)/(partial u) space d u + (partial y)/(partial v) space d v$,
$d z = (partial z)/(partial u) space d u + (partial z)/(partial v) space d v$

- We can now use the properties of the *wedge product* to evaluate any product of $d x$, $d y$, and $d z$ in terms of either $d u and d v$ or $d v and d u$ (but remember $d v and d u = -d u and d v$).

- This gives an integral of the form:

$integral bold(G)(u, v) space d u and d v =$
$integral.double bold(G)(u, v) space d u space d v$

== Integration with Differential Forms

- What we just did was construct a specific integral for a 2 manifold in 3 space, but this procedure can in general be done for a $k$ manifold in $n$ space, where the function we are integrating has dimension $mat(n; k)$.

#pause

- We can also take wedge products of more than 2 vectors to get multivectors, but these have only two canonical orientations
  - More on this later, but for now just know that we can always flip terms to get them in a certain order by multiplying either by $1$, positive orientation, or $-1$, negative orientation

== Notational Hacks

- We call the entire expression after the integral sign, when expressed with multivectors, a *differential form*, commonly denoted $omega$
  - Note that multivectors won't always have a wedge product symbol (for one or zero (we'll encounter those later) manifolds we only need a differential or scalar, respectively)
  - Common notation is to use $omega$ for a differential form and $Omega$ for a manifold, just to be extra confusing

#pause

- We use a completely made-up, contrived operation called the *pullback* to turn this abstract mess of symbols into a readable integral we can evaluate
  - Basically, use an intrinsic coordinate system that represents the manifold itself and not the space it's embedded in

A real mathematician must be able to generalise and specialise.

== Differential Forms and Orientability

- The *antisymmetry* property of differential forms give us a convenient way to determine the orientation of a parameterization of some manifold.

#pause

#pause

== Proof of Properties of a Boundary

If you're interested:

#text(size: 14pt)[
our definition $=> exists space phi: U -> HH^k$ where $U$ is the neighborhood of points around some $P in partial M$ and $HH^k$ is a half $k$ ball, formally defined as $HH^k = {x in RR^k | x_k >= 0}$ for some intrinsic coordinate system where $x_k = 0$ for points along the boundary in $U$ (otherwise a local neighborhood around these points would be homeomorphic to $RR^k$, not $HH^k$).\*
Thus, $partial M$ is homeomorphic to ${x in HH^k | x_k = 0}$, which is homeomorphic to $RR^(k-1)$ (simply reparameterize by eliminating $x_k$ and keeping all other parameters the same--for the inverse map add $x_k = 0$).

- Compute the normal vector $vec(n)$ satisfying $vec(n) dot vec(T_(x_i)) = 0 space forall space vec(T_(x_i))$ and $vec(n) dot d vec(rho) < 0$ where $vec(rho)$ is a basis vector of $T_P M$ not along $partial M$ and $T_P M$ is the tangent space of $M$

#pause

- Express $vec(n) and T_(x_1) and ... and T_(x_(n-1))$ in the form $A space T_(x_1) and ... and T_(x_n)$ where $d T_(x_1) and ... and d T_(x_n)$ is the canonical positive orientation of $M$

== Exterior Derivative

Consider a nasty differential form like:

$omega = M(x,y,z) space d y and d z + N(x,y,z) space d z and d x + P(x,y,z) space d x and d y$

where $vec(F) = angle.l M(x,y,z), N(x,y,z), P(x,y,z) angle.r$ (remember flux??)

#pause

Can we _differentiate_ $omega$?

== Digression to Introduce the Scale of the Problem

  We will need to use some very simple notions of category theory, an *esoteric subject* noted for its *difficulty* and *irrelevance*.

#pause

What we want to do is turn an $n$ form into an $n+1$ form.

#pause

=== Why?

Because we still want to integrate the resulting form (we want a differential, not a derivative)!
Think of how, in 1 dimension, we take $f(x) -> f'(x) space d x$ to produce a differential we can integrate over.

You should be thinking of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus right now\

== Definition of the Exterior Derivative

#tblock(title: "Exterior Derivative")[
  Given an $n$ form $omega = f space d x_1 and ... and d x_n$, we define the exterior derivative $d omega =  d f and d x_1 and ... and d x_n$, an $n+1$ form (trivial to see given we have added another wedge product and $d f$ is a 1 form)
]

#pause

Back to our example (let $cal(D) = angle.l d x, d y, d z angle.r$),

#pause

$d omega = (nabla f dot cal(D)) and d y and d z + (nabla g dot cal(D)) and d z and d x + (nabla h dot cal(D)) and d x and d y$

#pause

Terms of the form $d a and ... and d a ... and d b = 0$, so we exclude them:

#pause

$d omega = f_x space d x and d y and d z + g_y space d y and d z and d x + h_z space d z and d x and d y$\
$d omega = (f_x + g_y + h_z) space d x and d y and d z$

== Powers of the Exterior Derivative

*That looks familiar!*

#pause

It's $op("div") vec(F) space d V$ (using the fact that $d V = d x and d y and d z$)

#pause

- Flux becomes divergence?
- Where have you seen this before??
