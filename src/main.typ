= Stokes Theorem

== Manifolds

#set quote(block: true)
#quote(attribution: "Henri PoincarÃ©")[Geometry is the art of correct reasoning from incorrectly drawn figures.]

#pause

*Manifolds are (very special) sets (of points)*

#pause

- Manifolds are just a continuous set of points

#pause

- Moreover, at any given point, they look like a *Euclidean space*

== Euclidean Spaces

- You know them as $RR^n$ i.e. *vector spaces* (roughly speaking)

#pause

- Euclidean space is the space we inhabit (not the full story; more on this later)

#pause

#v(12pt)

*What actually is a manifold then?*

#pause

- When we say that a manifold "looks like" a Euclidean space, we're actually talking about *homeomorphism*

== General Topology

#v(12pt)

#v(12pt)

- Topologists do not understand shapes, so they must deform objects into meaningless blobs to count holes

- Two numbers are equal, but two topological spaces are *homeomorphic* to each other

=== Definitions

#tblock(title: "Homeomorphism")[
  A pair of continuous bijective (all $x in X$ in the domain of $f$ and all $y in Y$ in the range of $f$) mappings $f: X --> Y$ and $f^(-1): Y --> X$
]

#tblock(title: "Homeomorphic equivalence")[
  Two topological objects $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic to each other iff there exists a *homeomorphism* between them.
]

== Formalizing the Manifold

=== Definitions

Read: more abstract nonsense

#tblock(title: "Manifold")[
  A $k$ (represents intrinsic dimension) manifold is a continuous set of points $X$ *homeomorphic* to $RR^k$
]

#tblock(title: "Embedding")[
  The embedding of a manifold $X$ is $n$ iff $x in RR^n space forall x in X$
]

*Note*: If a $k$ manifold is embedded in $n$ space ($RR^n$), we must have $n>k$ (this is a trivial consequence of an advanced mathematical technique called "visualization")

#v(12pt)

We live in a *3 manifold* (possibly embedded in a _higher dimensional_ space--and we have no way of knowing)!

Completely irrelevant to understanding Generalized Stokes Theorem, but very cool nevertheless.
